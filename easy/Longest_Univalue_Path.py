"""
Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

Example 1:

Input:

              5
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          1   1   5
Output:

2
Example 2:

Input:

              1
             / \
            4   5
           / \   \
          4   4   5
Output:

2
