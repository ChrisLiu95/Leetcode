"""

A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).

Find all strobogrammatic numbers that are of length = n.

For example,
Given n = 2, return ["11","69","88","96"].


Some observation to the sequence:

n == 1: [0, 1, 8]

n == 2: [11, 88, 69, 96]

How about n == 3?
=> it can be retrieved if you insert [0, 1, 8] to the middle of solution of n == 2

n == 4?
=> it can be retrieved if you insert [11, 88, 69, 96, 00] to the middle of solution of n == 2

n == 5?
=> it can be retrieved if you insert [0, 1, 8] to the middle of solution of n == 4

the same, for n == 6, it can be retrieved if you insert [11, 88, 69, 96, 00] to the middle of solution of n == 4
